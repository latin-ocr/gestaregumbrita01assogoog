attempted to aflord a remedy to it¹ ⁴We have followed the
Parisian manuscript and given in our appendix the various
readings of the two others as iar as we could lrom a carelul
collatiou5 the only alteration introduced into our text is the
introduction oi punctuation and the subsstitution oi v and j,
when required. l-lnd we had aeoess to the manuscript oi
Valenciennes, we should have collated the whole oi the
poem ; but we have only seen the fragment ior which we aro
indebted to Μ. de Gaulle; and on finding how close it is to
the Parisian manuscript, nohody will regret not having any
more nithe various readings*

We hope the small poems printed in the appendix on the
same subject will be acceptable as a proper sequel to the
‘¹ Gesta regum Britanniae ''. We have transcribed them [rom
two manuscripts in the British Museum, aud we have care-
lully compared the proot's with the originals; hut we must

is indeed very incorr-eet. As to the Norman poem, we are
at a loss to pronounee whether it is, or is not, a translation or
a Latin tract which frequently occurs in the English libraries,
namely in three Cottouian manuscripts ¹. With another
poem on Brutus preserved in the Royal Library or Munich ¹ 3
